# GenerativeAiCharacterCreator
 A Generative Ai character creator designed to exemplify the biases found in generative Ai systems

 This project requires a stable diffusion checkpoint to run. Specifically StableDiffusion V1-5 as is required for control Net
 This should be placed in AiCharacterCreator/StableDiffusion-Webui-Master/Models/Stable-Diffusion

 This proect requires a control net openpose interpretor such as control_v11p_sd15_openpose
This should be placed in AiCharacterCreator\stable-diffusion-webui-master\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet\models and in AiCharacterCreator\stable-diffusion-webui-master\models\ControlNet

Finally the virtual environment for stable diffusion must be activated correctly
This can be done with the WebUI scripts in AiCharacterCreator\stable-diffusion-webui-master and further instructions can be found in the Automatic1111 repository
